// PGS (Blu-ray graphic subtitles) out of Matroska.
//
// Matroska stores an S_HDMV/PGS block as a bare run of segments -- type (u8),
// length (u16 BE), body -- with the presentation time carried by the block
// timestamp. A .sup file stores the same segments, but prefixes each one with
// a 10-byte header: "PG", then PTS and DTS as 32-bit 90 kHz values.
//
// Every PGS decoder on npm reads .sup, because that is the format you get out
// of a Blu-ray. Rather than reimplement RLE decoding, palette handling and
// window composition, this rebuilds the 10 bytes per segment that the muxer
// dropped and hands the decoder exactly the format it already parses.
//
// Verified against the test files by tools/test-pgs.mjs, which round-trips
// real demuxed packets through libpgs.
